## 🔍 Reflection

### 🔧 Challenges Faced

- Getting the filtering and pagination to work together was tricky  
- Making the UI responsive across all screen sizes  
- Managing in-memory data for CRUD without persistence  

### 🧠 What I’d Improve

- Use localStorage to persist data  
- Add animations for smoother UX  
- Use Freemarker templating in a real Java backend setup  
- Enhance form with real-time validation feedback  

---

## 📌 Notes

- This app does not use any external APIs or databases  
- Built entirely with HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Freemarker-like structure followed for templates (FTL style)
